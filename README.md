# my-portfolio

- I used a free template as a base for my portfolio site, then I customized and edited it using my understanding, research, and with the help of ChatGPT.
- So, don't think that I a pro in web dev because I am not.
- Also, I used the code for web based terminal in my portfolio from a YouTube tutorial and
again edited and cuztomized it.

- All this to improve my source code review skills and to make it all look cooler.
